this is the work for Concordium Hackathon Basically, I downloaded rust and cargo on my pc (in fact cargo concordium --help give me the right output) then I installed concordium client, checked the installation and connected to the testnet mode then come my favorite part: the creation of the concordium wallet, a well projected web wallet I created one and then import 2000 CCD through the testnet faucet after all, I exported the keys of wallet in a .export file at the end i import the key into my concordium-client configuration successfully!

my mainnet address is: 3pwegUv78yqm1MdUdXQ1Pxys73E38FLjuYM8KzJZuxgeQZF1r3

thanks to concordium team for the well-written docs!
